# 🎯 Interview Answer: *“How do you handle delays or missed sprint goals as a Tech Lead?”*

**“First, I believe delays should never come as a surprise. That’s why I track progress daily through Jira burndown charts, stand-ups, and one-on-one check-ins. If I notice velocity dipping or a story at risk, I act early.”**

👉 Then I explain my **3-step approach** with a small story:

---

### 1️⃣ Identify & Communicate Early

* Example: “Recently, a critical integration story was at risk because of unexpected API changes from a third-party. As soon as I saw this in stand-up, I immediately flagged it in Jira and informed the product owner.”
* By being transparent, stakeholders trust us and can make business adjustments early.

---

### 2️⃣ Unblock & Re-prioritize

* “I worked with the developer, jumped in hands-on, and helped debug the API issue. At the same time, I re-prioritized lower-priority tasks so we didn’t block other team members.”
* If needed, we break big tasks into smaller shippable increments so at least partial value is delivered on time.

---

### 3️⃣ Learn & Improve

* “At the sprint retrospective, we discussed why this risk wasn’t spotted earlier and updated our Definition of Ready to always include dependency checks before starting. This way, we improved and avoided the same delay in future sprints.”

# 🌟 Closing Line

**“So for me, handling delays is about early visibility, proactive communication, quick re-prioritization, and most importantly, learning from it to improve the next sprint. I focus on owning the problem, not blaming, so the team stays motivated and stakeholders stay confident.”**

⚡ This answer shows:

* You **don’t panic** when delays happen.
* You **own the problem**, not just escalate.
* You **improve the process** instead of repeating mistakes.
