Nice 👍 this is another **interview keyword** where they expect you to explain:

1. **What tools you’ve used (Azure DevOps, Git, GitHub, Jenkins, etc.)**
2. **How you used them in your project** (day-to-day workflow).
3. **Why they matter** (automation, faster delivery, fewer bugs).

Let’s craft a **storytelling answer** you can use in interviews 👇

# 🌟 **Interview Answer: Hands-on with Source Control & CI/CD (Azure DevOps)**

**“In my current role as Tech Lead, I work daily with Git-based source control and Azure DevOps pipelines for CI/CD. Let me explain how we use them in our project.”**

---

## 1️⃣ **Source Control (Git in Azure Repos / GitHub)**

* We follow **Git Flow branching strategy**:

  * `main` → stable production code
  * `develop` → ongoing integration
  * `feature/*` → new features
  * `hotfix/*` → urgent fixes
* Developers create **pull requests (PRs)** for code reviews.
* We enforce **policies**:

  * At least 2 reviewers must approve.
  * Build + tests must pass before merge.

✅ This ensures **code quality and avoids breaking production**.

---

## 2️⃣ **CI (Continuous Integration) with Azure Pipelines**

* Every commit triggers a **CI pipeline**:

  1. Pulls the latest code from repo.
  2. Restores NuGet packages.
  3. Builds the solution.
  4. Runs **NUnit/xUnit tests**.
  5. Runs **SonarQube static code analysis** (or FxCop analyzers).
* If any step fails, PR cannot be merged.

✅ This keeps the main branch always in a **working, tested state**.

---

## 3️⃣ **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) with Azure Pipelines**

* Once CI passes, **CD pipeline** automatically deploys:

  * First to **Dev environment** for internal testing.
  * Then to **QA/UAT** after approvals.
  * Finally to **Production** with controlled approvals (manual gates).
* We use **Azure DevOps Environments + Deployment slots** for zero-downtime upgrades.
* Configurations are stored in **Key Vault** and pipelines use **variables groups** for secrets.

✅ This ensures **fast, reliable deployments** multiple times per week.

---

## 4️⃣ **Real Project Example (American Water IoT)**

* In our IoT project:

  * Source control (Git + PRs) helped manage parallel development of billing, alerting, and reporting microservices.
  * CI pipeline ensured no bad code or failing tests entered the repo.
  * CD pipeline deployed microservices to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** automatically.
  * Rollbacks were handled using **Helm + versioned Docker images**.

---

## 🌟 **Interview Soundbite**

**“I use Git-based source control with PR reviews to maintain clean code, and Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployments across multiple environments. For example, in my American Water project, our pipelines deployed microservices to AKS with zero downtime. This automation reduced manual errors, sped up delivery, and gave us confidence to release features faster.”**
