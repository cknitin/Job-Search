"When dealing with SQL Server performance issues, especially with slow queries on large tables with millions of records, I approach optimization in layers:

1. Query-Level Optimization

Analyze execution plans (identify scans vs. seeks).

Rewrite queries to use sargable predicates (avoid LIKE '%abc', functions on columns).

Reduce use of SELECT *, fetch only required columns.

2. Indexing Strategy

Add covering indexes for frequently used queries.

Use composite indexes in correct order.

Periodically rebuild/reorganize fragmented indexes.

Leverage filtered indexes for selective data.

3. Database Design Improvements

Partition large tables (range partitioning for date columns).

Archive old data into separate tables or cold storage (Azure Blob, Data Lake).

Use appropriate datatypes (avoid NVARCHAR(MAX) when NVARCHAR(100) is enough).

4. Caching & Denormalization

Cache frequent reads in Redis / In-Memory Cache.

Pre-aggregate heavy queries into materialized views or summary tables.

Use denormalization carefully for reporting scenarios.

5. Concurrency & Locking

Optimize isolation levels (use READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT to reduce blocking).

Batch updates/deletes instead of running huge transactions.

6. Monitoring & Tools

Use SQL Profiler / Extended Events for tracing bottlenecks.

Track slow queries in Azure SQL Insights / Query Store.

"For example, in my last project, we had a table with 50M+ records where reporting queries were very slow. I partitioned the table by month and created a covering index on (UserId, CreatedDate). Query time dropped from 40 seconds to under 3 seconds. We also cached top 10 reports in Redis, reducing DB load by 70%."

🚀 Tips to Impress

Don’t just say “I’ll add indexes” → That sounds junior.

Show layered thinking (query → index → partition → caching → monitoring).

Always end with a real-world example → it proves you’ve done it.

Perfect 👍 — let’s take **SQL performance bottleneck** as a **deep-dive case study** because it’s very common and interviewers like when you explain it step by step like a real story.

# 🏗️ Deep-Dive Story: SQL Performance Bottleneck

**“One of the biggest technical challenges I faced in my current project was a performance bottleneck in SQL Server as data volume grew. Let me explain step by step how I handled it.”**

---

### ⚡ Step 1: The Problem

* Our **user feed API** started becoming very slow (\~6–7 seconds response time).
* Business stakeholders complained because users were dropping off due to the delay.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Investigation

* I checked the **SQL execution plans** and noticed:

  * Table scans instead of index seeks.
  * A few stored procedures had nested subqueries and `ORDER BY` on non-indexed columns.
  * Queries pulling too much unnecessary data.

* We also saw **locks & blocking** in production due to missing indexing strategy.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Solution Approach

1. **Indexing Strategy**

   * Added **clustered index** on primary keys and **non-clustered indexes** on frequently queried columns (like `UserId`, `CreatedDate`).
   * Added **covering indexes** for reporting queries.

2. **Query Optimization**

   * Rewrote nested subqueries into **joins** and **CTEs**.
   * Limited result sets with proper pagination (`OFFSET / FETCH`).
   * Removed unused columns from SELECT.

3. **Caching**

   * Implemented **Redis caching** for frequently accessed user feeds.
   * This reduced repeated hits on the database.

4. **Batching Updates**

   * Instead of updating `ReadCount` row by row, I changed it to **batch updates in jobs of 50 records**.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Outcome

* API response time improved from **6–7 seconds to under 500 ms**.
* Database CPU usage dropped by \~40%.
* End users experienced **much faster app performance**, improving engagement.
* Team learned to include **query performance reviews** in our Definition of Done.

# 🌟 Closing Line

**“So this challenge taught me that performance is not just about fixing one query, but about designing the right indexing strategy, optimizing queries, using caching, and even rethinking how data is updated. That’s how we solved it in a structured way.”**
