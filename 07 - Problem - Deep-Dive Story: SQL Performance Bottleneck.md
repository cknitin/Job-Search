# 🏗️ Deep-Dive Story: SQL Performance Bottleneck

**“One of the biggest technical challenges I faced in my current project was a performance bottleneck in SQL Server as data volume grew. Let me explain step by step how I handled it.”**

---

### ⚡ Step 1: The Problem

* Our **user feed API** started becoming very slow (\~6–7 seconds response time).
* Business stakeholders complained because users were dropping off due to the delay.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Investigation

* I checked the **SQL execution plans** and noticed:

  * Table scans instead of index seeks.
  * A few stored procedures had nested subqueries and `ORDER BY` on non-indexed columns.
  * Queries pulling too much unnecessary data.

* We also saw **locks & blocking** in production due to missing indexing strategy.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Solution Approach

1. **Indexing Strategy**

   * Added **clustered index** on primary keys and **non-clustered indexes** on frequently queried columns (like `UserId`, `CreatedDate`).
   * Added **covering indexes** for reporting queries.

2. **Query Optimization**

   * Rewrote nested subqueries into **joins** and **CTEs**.
   * Limited result sets with proper pagination (`OFFSET / FETCH`).
   * Removed unused columns from SELECT.

3. **Caching**

   * Implemented **Redis caching** for frequently accessed user feeds.
   * This reduced repeated hits on the database.

4. **Batching Updates**

   * Instead of updating `ReadCount` row by row, I changed it to **batch updates in jobs of 50 records**.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Outcome

* API response time improved from **6–7 seconds to under 500 ms**.
* Database CPU usage dropped by \~40%.
* End users experienced **much faster app performance**, improving engagement.
* Team learned to include **query performance reviews** in our Definition of Done.

# 🌟 Closing Line

**“So this challenge taught me that performance is not just about fixing one query, but about designing the right indexing strategy, optimizing queries, using caching, and even rethinking how data is updated. That’s how we solved it in a structured way.”**

👉 This kind of **step-by-step technical storytelling** makes you sound **hands-on, analytical, and leadership-ready**.
