**“In my current role as a Tech Lead, I manage both delivery and technical responsibilities. 
I use Jira for sprint planning and backlog prioritization, assign tickets, and ensure the team is aligned. 
On the development side, I do code reviews, enforce best practices, and guide developers when they’re stuck. 
Every commit goes through Azure DevOps pipelines for build, unit tests, and deployments across Dev, UAT, and Prod. 
I also coordinate with QA for testing, and once approved, I oversee production deployments and monitor stability. In short, 
I ensure the entire flow from user story in Jira to final delivery in production runs smoothly, on time, and with quality.”**
