Awesome‚Äîhere‚Äôs a clean, **interview-ready high-level architecture** for **American Water** that uses exactly the tech you listed: **.NET Core microservices, Azure Functions, App Services, Service Bus, Event Grid, API Management, and AKS**. It‚Äôs structured so you can *tell the story* and also *build it*.

---

# üéØ One-sentence overview

An event-driven, microservices platform where **ingress APIs** are fronted by **API Management**, **compute** runs on **AKS + App Service + Functions**, **events** flow via **Event Grid**, **reliable workflows** use **Service Bus**, and everything is observable, secure, and CI/CD-driven.

---

# üß± Microservice landscape (DDD style)

**Core bounded contexts (each a .NET 8 Web API):**

1. **Device Registry Service** (AKS): register meters/sensors, digital twins, keys, firmware metadata.
2. **Telemetry Ingest Service** (AKS / App Service): receives readings (HTTP or gRPC), validates schema, publishes internal events.
3. **Operations/Maintenance Service** (AKS): work orders, crews, SLAs, parts inventory.
4. **Quality & Compliance Service** (AKS): contamination rules, thresholds, audit trails.
5. **Customer & Billing Service** (App Service): accounts, consumption, tariffs, invoices, credits.
6. **Notification Service** (Functions + App Service): SMS/email/push, templates, rate-limits.
7. **Reporting & Analytics API** (App Service): query-oriented, backed by read models.

**Event backbone**

* **Event Grid** for **pub/sub** domain events (e.g., `Water.PressureExceeded`, `Quality.ContaminationDetected`, `Billing.CycleStarted`).
* **Service Bus** (queues & topics) for **commands/workflows** with guaranteed delivery, ordering, and retries (e.g., `CreateWorkOrder`, `SendBillingReminder`, `IssueCredit`).

**Edge/gateway**

* **API Management** (APIM) in front of all public/partner APIs with policies (throttle, JWT validation, IP restrictions, header transforms, API versioning).

**Compute placement**

* **AKS** for long-running microservices & internal APIs.
* **App Service** for customer-facing web/API apps that need simpler ops.
* **Azure Functions** for event handlers, glue code, timers, and fan-out/fan-in.

# üîÅ End-to-end flows (the story you‚Äôll tell)

## Flow A ‚Äî ‚ÄúIncident from a sensor reading to a field crew on site‚Äù

1. **Sensor ‚Üí APIM ‚Üí Telemetry Ingest Service (AKS)**

   * Device posts JSON (meterId, pressure, turbidity, timestamp).
   * APIM policy: validate JWT/client cert, rate limit, reject oversized payloads.
2. **Ingest publishes event** ‚Üí **Event Grid**: `Water.TelemetryReceived`.
3. **Quality Rules Function** (EventGridTrigger) evaluates thresholds.

   * If `pressure > threshold` or `turbidity abnormal` ‚Üí emit `Quality.ContaminationDetected`.
4. **Event Grid fan-out** to subscribers:

   * **Operations/Maintenance Service** (AKS) receives ‚Üí emits **Service Bus command** `CreateWorkOrder`.
   * **Notification Function** receives ‚Üí queues `SendEmergencyAlert` on **Service Bus**.
   * **Customer & Billing Service** receives ‚Üí schedules **preventive credit** (via Service Bus).
5. **Service Bus** orchestrates reliable actions:

   * **WorkOrderProcessor Function** (ServiceBusTrigger) creates the order, assigns crew, updates status.
   * **Notifications Processor** sends SMS/email/push; DLQ captures failures; retry with backoff.
6. **Event Grid** emits `Ops.WorkOrderDispatched` & `Customer.AlertSent` for system-wide visibility.
7. **Reporting API** projects events to read models for dashboards.

**Why this shines:** Event Grid = instant fan-out & loose coupling; Service Bus = guaranteed workflows; Functions = small, focused brains.

---

## Flow B ‚Äî ‚ÄúMonthly billing with credits & reminders‚Äù

1. **Timer Function** (cron) emits `Billing.CycleStarted` (Event Grid).
2. Subscribers:

   * **Customer & Billing Service** calculates invoices (AKS), publishes `Billing.InvoiceReady`.
   * **Notification Service** enqueues reminders on **Service Bus** (`SendBillingReminder`).
3. **Billing Processor Function** (ServiceBusTrigger) sends reminders, tracks outcomes, DLQ for failures.
4. **If incident credits exist** (from Flow A), **Billing Service** applies credits and republish `Billing.InvoiceUpdated`.
5. **APIM** exposes `/billing/invoices` to customers/apps; cached & rate-limited.

---

## Flow C ‚Äî ‚ÄúDevice onboarding & lifecycle‚Äù

1. Operator uses **Portal (App Service)** behind **APIM** ‚Üí calls **Device Registry Service** (AKS).
2. Registry issues credentials/keys, emits `Device.Registered` (Event Grid).
3. **Ingest Service** subscribes ‚Üí whitelists device; **Notification** sends welcome/config.
4. Firmware updates or decommission events follow the same event pattern.

---

# üß¨ Contracts, triggers & bindings (quick reference)

* **Event Grid**: domain events (`*.Detected`, `*.Started`, `*.Ready`, `*.Dispatched`).

  * Functions: `[EventGridTrigger]` for rule checks, fan-out, projections.
* **Service Bus**: commands/tasks (`CreateWorkOrder`, `SendSMS`, `IssueCredit`).

  * Functions: `[ServiceBusTrigger]` + output bindings; use sessions for ordering per customer/asset.
* **HTTP (APIM)**: public/partner endpoints; APIM policies for JWT validation (Entra ID), IP allowlist, caching, transformation.
* **Timers**: `[TimerTrigger]` for billing cycles, backfills, housekeeping.

---

# üóÑÔ∏è Data & storage (choose per service)

* **Operational**: Azure SQL for billing & customer; Cosmos DB for telemetry snapshots/device twins; Blob/Data Lake for raw payloads & archives.
* **Projections/Read models**: materialized views in Azure SQL or Cosmos DB.
* **State & cache**: Redis for hot lookups and throttling counters.

---

# üîí Security & governance

* **Identity**: Entra ID (AAD) for user/apps; APIM validates tokens.
* **Network**: Private endpoints for App Service/Functions, AKS in private cluster, APIM in internal VNet with Azure Firewall/WAF.
* **Secrets**: Key Vault + managed identity for services.
* **Data**: At-rest encryption (platform), TLS 1.2+, customer data masking in non-prod.

---

# üìà Observability & reliability

* **App Insights** everywhere (distributed tracing: `traceparent` from APIM ‚Üí AKS ‚Üí Functions).
* **Log Analytics** for centralized queries & alerts.
* **Resilience**: Service Bus DLQs, poison-message handling, idempotent consumers, retries with jitter, circuit breakers in AKS services (Polly).
* **SLAs/SLOs**: define per flow (e.g., ‚Äúcritical alert fan-out < 5s p95‚Äù).

---

# üöÄ CI/CD & environments

* **Repos**: one repo per service (mono- or multi-repo is fine with standards).
* **Pipelines**: GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps ‚Äî build, test, containerize (AKS), deploy infra (Bicep/Terraform), then apps.
* **Promotion**: Dev ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Prod with approvals; blue-green/Canary on AKS via ingress annotations.
* **APIM**: declarative (APIs as code), versioned revisions, automated policy deployment.

---

# üß™ Minimal ‚Äúhello-flow‚Äù to demo

1. POST `/telemetry` via **APIM** ‚Üí Ingest Service.
2. Ingest emits `Water.PressureExceeded` (Event Grid).
3. Function reacts, enqueues `CreateWorkOrder` (Service Bus).
4. Another Function creates a mock work order & emits `Ops.WorkOrderDispatched` (Event Grid).
5. Watch logs/traces in **App Insights**, view DLQ empty, confirm end-to-end within seconds.

---

# üó∫Ô∏è Quick RACI (who runs where)

* **AKS**: Device Registry, Telemetry Ingest, Ops/Maintenance, Quality, Billing, internal gateways.
* **App Service**: Customer/Billing public API & Web, Reporting API, portals.
* **Functions**: Rules engine, projections, notifications, schedulers, glue code.
* **APIM**: single front door for all external APIs.
* **Event Grid**: domain event bus.
* **Service Bus**: command & workflow backbone.

If you want, I can tailor this into a **one-page slide** (architecture diagram + key bullets) or a **demo checklist** you can run through live.
