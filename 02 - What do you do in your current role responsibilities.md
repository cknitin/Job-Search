# üåü Answer: ‚ÄúWhat do you do in your current role / responsibilities?‚Äù

**‚ÄúIn my current role as a Tech Lead and Enterprise Architect, I manage both technical and leadership responsibilities. On the Agile side, I use Jira for sprint planning, backlog grooming, and tracking progress. I work closely with the product owner to prioritize tickets and refine user stories based on business value and technical feasibility. I also conduct daily stand-ups and sprint retrospectives to ensure the team stays aligned.**

**From a delivery perspective, I oversee the complete cycle ‚Äî from development to unit testing, UAT, and finally production deployment. I ensure code reviews are performed thoroughly, enforcing coding standards, SOLID principles, and design patterns. For CI/CD, I‚Äôve set up Azure DevOps pipelines that automate build, unit tests, static code analysis, and deployment across environments. This allows us to deliver features faster and with fewer production issues.**

**My day-to-day also includes mentoring developers, helping with technical blockers, reviewing architecture decisions, and ensuring high-quality delivery. Ultimately, my role is to balance technical design, team productivity, and business delivery so that projects are released on time, with quality, and aligned to enterprise architecture best practices.‚Äù**
