# What .net and C# version you are using. Currently which is the latest version of .net and c#?

This is a **tricky but common interviewer question** 🙂 — they want to check two things:

1. Whether you are **hands-on and up to date**.
2. Whether you can **differentiate between what you currently use vs what is latest in market**.

Here’s how to **smartly answer** 👇

💡 **Strong Interview Answer (Smart Style)**

\*"In my current project, we are working on **.NET 8** with **C# 12**, since that is the LTS release and well-suited for enterprise workloads.

As of today, the **latest version in the market** is **.NET 9 with C# 13**, released in November 2024. However, .NET 9 is a **Standard-Term Support (STS)** version, while .NET 8 remains the **current Long-Term Support (LTS)** version.

So for production enterprise applications, many companies stick with **.NET 8 LTS**, while we keep exploring new features from .NET 9 and C# 13 for future adoption."\*

✅ Why this sounds smart:

* You **differentiate between current usage** vs **latest available**.
* You show awareness of **LTS vs STS** strategy (many interviewers love this detail).
* You name **C# version with .NET version** correctly.
* You show **practical judgment** (using stable version in enterprise, but staying aware of new ones).

---

👉 Quick fact sheet (if interviewer drills further):

* **.NET 8 (LTS)** — released Nov 2023, supports until Nov 2026.
* **.NET 9 (STS)** — released Nov 2024, supported until May 2025.
* **C# 12** ships with .NET 8.
* **C# 13** ships with .NET 9.

Do you want me to also prepare a **one-liner crisp answer** (like a 10-second reply) in case the interviewer expects a quick factual response instead of a detailed explanation?


# If you work on .net 8 and C#, what feature both have and what you are using in current project.

Great follow-up 👍 This is a **classic deep-dive question** — the interviewer is testing two things:

1. Do you know **.NET 8 and C# 12 features**?
2. Can you **map them to your real project** (not just theory)?

Here’s a **smart structured reply** you can give:

💡 **Strong Interview Answer**

\*"In our current project, we’re on **.NET 8 with C# 12**, building APIs hosted in Azure with Service Bus, Event Grid, Blob Storage, and Cosmos DB.

From the **.NET 8** side, I really like:

* **Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation** → which helps reduce memory footprint and startup time, especially for microservices and Azure Functions.
* **Improved minimal APIs** → we’re using them in lighter services where we don’t need the full MVC stack.
* **Performance improvements in EF Core 8** → we use bulk operations and better LINQ translations to optimize Cosmos DB and SQL queries.
* **Rate limiting middleware** → useful in our APIs to protect downstream services when handling spikes in traffic.

From the **C# 12** side:

* **Primary constructors for classes** → makes our DTOs and service classes cleaner, especially in dependency injection scenarios.
* **Default lambda parameters** → simplifies Azure Service Bus message handlers where we use delegates with optional parameters.
* **Collection expressions** → making initialization of in-memory config and test data much more concise.

So in short, we’re not just on the latest version — we’re actually using features like **AOT, rate limiting, EF Core 8 improvements, and C# 12 primary constructors** in our day-to-day implementation."\*

✅ Why this answer works:

* Mentions **specific .NET 8 features** (AOT, minimal APIs, EF Core 8, rate limiting).
* Mentions **specific C# 12 features** (primary constructors, default lambda parameters, collection expressions).
* Connects them to **your real Azure project** (Service Bus, Event Grid, Cosmos, APIs).
* Sounds practical, not just “I read release notes.”
