# Design Patterns Guide - Gang of Four (GoF)

## 1. Creational Patterns (How objects are created)

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms.

### Patterns:
- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### Mnemonic to remember:
**Some Friends Always Build Properties** (Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)

### Tip:
Think of "Creational" as "Creating objects"â€”all patterns here are about how to create objects in different ways.

## 2. Structural Patterns (How classes and objects are organized)

These patterns deal with object composition and relationships between classes and objects.

### Patterns:
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### Mnemonic to remember:
**All Bridges Can Decorate Fly Properties** (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)

### Tip:
"Structural" means "structure" of objects and classes, and these patterns define how objects are put together.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns (How objects interact and communicate)

These patterns focus on how objects communicate and interact with one another.

### Patterns:
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**
- **Visitor**

### Mnemonic to remember:
**Can Commanders Interact In Many Methods? Observe States Strategically Through Visits** (Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor)

### Tip:
"Behavioral" means "how behaviors (or interactions) are managed." These patterns manage object communication.
